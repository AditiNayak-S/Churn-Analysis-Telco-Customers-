        "## Project Objective\n",
        "The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior within a telecommunication dataset to predict which customers are likely to churn (leave the service). The insights gained from this analysis can help the business take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tools Used\n",
        "*   **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and machine learning.\n",
        "*   **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.\n",
        "*   **numpy**: Numerical computing library.\n",
        "*   **matplotlib**: Data visualization library.\n",
        "*   **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization library.\n",
        "*   **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model development and evaluation.\n",
        "*   **sqlite3**: For database integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Loading and Initial Exploration\n",
        "The project starts by loading the Telco Customer Churn dataset, typically from a CSV file (e.g., `Telco Customer Churn Kaggle.zip`).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Dataset Shape**: (7043 rows, 21 columns)\n",
        "*   **Columns**: `customerID`, `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`, `tenure`, `PhoneService`, `MultipleLines`, `InternetService`, `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, `DeviceProtection`, `TechSupport`, `StreamingTV`, `StreamingMovies`, `Contract`, `PaperlessBilling`, `PaymentMethod`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`, `Churn`.\n",
        "*   **Data Types**: Includes `object` (strings), `int64` (integers), and `float64` (floats).\n",
        "*   **Churn Distribution**: The dataset shows an imbalance, with 'No' churn (5174 customers) being significantly higher than 'Yes' churn (1869 customers).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
        "Several visualizations were generated to understand the data:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Customer Churn Distribution**: A count plot showed the imbalance in the churn target variable.\n",
        "*   **Tenure vs Churn**: Box plots revealed that customers who churned generally have lower tenure compared to those who did not churn.\n",
        "*   **Monthly Charges vs Churn**: Box plots indicated that churning customers tend to have higher monthly charges.\n",
        "*   **Contract Type vs Churn**: A count plot highlighted that customers with month-to-month contracts have a much higher churn rate than those with one-year or two-year contracts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Preprocessing\n",
        "The following steps were performed to prepare the data for machine learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **TotalCharges Conversion**: The `TotalCharges` column, initially an `object` type, was converted to `numeric`. `errors='coerce'` was used to handle any non-numeric values, converting them to `NaN`.\n",
        "2.  **Handling Missing Values**: Rows with `NaN` values (primarily from `TotalCharges` after conversion) were dropped. This resulted in the DataFrame having no missing values.\n",
        "3.  **Feature Engineering**: The `customerID` column was dropped as it's an identifier and not relevant for modeling.\n",
        "4.  **Target Variable Encoding**: The `Churn` column ('Yes'/'No') was encoded into numerical format (1/0) for model training.\n",
        "5.  **Categorical Feature Encoding**: Categorical features were identified and converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding (`pd.get_dummies`). `drop_first=True` was used to avoid multicollinearity.\n",
        "6.  **Numerical Feature Scaling**: Numerical features (`SeniorCitizen`, `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`) were scaled using `StandardScaler` to bring them to a similar scale, which is beneficial for many machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression.\n",
        "7.  **Data Splitting**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test) using `train_test_split` with `random_state=42` for reproducibility and `stratify=y` to maintain the original churn distribution in both sets.\n",

        "## Database Integration\n",
        "The processed data was also stored in a SQLite database (`churn_analysis.db`) across three tables: `customers`, `services`, and `billing`. This allows for SQL-based querying and analysis.\n",
        "\n",

        "*   **Example Query**: A query to calculate churn rate by contract type was executed.\n",
        "    *   *Note*: The `churn` column in the `billing` table was populated with original 'Yes'/'No' labels during the database creation phase, leading to incorrect numerical aggregation for churn rate. This would need to be re-encoded to 0/1 for accurate churn rate calculation within SQL. The current output showed 0% churn for all contract types due to this.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion and Recommendations\n",
        "This analysis successfully identified key factors influencing customer churn and developed predictive models. The class-weighted Logistic Regression model, particularly with an adjusted threshold, showed promising recall for identifying churners, which is critical for retention strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Findings:**\n",
        "*   Customers on month-to-month contracts, with higher monthly charges, and shorter tenure are more likely to churn.\n",
        "*   Fiber optic internet service and electronic check payment methods are also associated with higher churn.\n",
        "*   Customers with two-year contracts, longer tenure, and those subscribed to online security or tech support are less likely to churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendations:**\n",
        "*   **Targeted Retention Programs**: Focus retention efforts on customers identified as 'High Risk' or 'Medium Risk', especially those with month-to-month contracts and fiber optic internet.\n",
        "*   **Contract Incentives**: Offer incentives for customers to switch from month-to-month to longer-term contracts (one-year or two-year).\n",
        "*   **Service Bundle Review**: Investigate the services that correlate with higher churn (e.g., fiber optic, streaming services) to understand underlying issues.\n",
        "*   **Payment Method Analysis**: Explore reasons behind higher churn with electronic checks; consider offering alternative, more stable payment incentives.\n",
        "*   **Proactive Engagement**: Implement strategies to engage customers with lower tenure or increasing monthly charges before they reach a high-risk churn probability.\n"
